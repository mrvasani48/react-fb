# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

1. Prepare your project
   Before publishing your React project to npm, ensure that it's ready for distribution. This includes:

Testing: Make sure your project passes all tests.
Documentation: Write clear documentation for your project, including how to install, configure, and use it.
Versioning: Decide on the version number for your package. Following semantic versioning (semver.org) is recommended. 2. Create an npm account
If you don't already have an npm account, you'll need to create one. You can sign up for free at npmjs.com/signup.

3. Log in to npm
   Once you have an npm account, log in to the npm CLI on your machine by running:

Copy code
npm login
Enter your npm username, password, and email when prompted.

4. Set up your package.json
   Make sure your package.json file is configured correctly. At a minimum, it should include the following fields:

name: The name of your package (should be unique).
version: The version of your package.
description: A brief description of your package.
main: The entry point of your package (typically the main JavaScript file).
author: Your name or the name of your organization.
license: The license under which your package is distributed. 5. Build your project
Before publishing, you might want to build your React project if it's not already built. You can do this using your preferred build tool (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, or Create React App). Ensure that the build output is included in your .gitignore file.

6. Publish your package
   Once your project is ready, navigate to its root directory in your terminal and run:

Copy code
npm publish
This command will publish your package to the npm registry. Make sure you have appropriate permissions to publish the package under the specified name.

7. Verify
   After publishing, you can verify that your package was published successfully by visiting its page on the npm website (https://www.npmjs.com/package/your-package-name).

Additional Tips:
Semantic Versioning: Follow semantic versioning guidelines to manage your package versions effectively.
README: Write a detailed README file that explains how to install, configure, and use your package.
Keywords: Add relevant keywords to your package.json to make your package easier to discover.
License: Choose an appropriate open-source license for your package and include it in your package.json.
By following these steps, you should be able to publish your React project to npm successfully.
